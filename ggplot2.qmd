# `ggplot2`

For an accompanying video, see `ggplot2.mp4`.

## Motivation

Creating attractive graphics is a crucial part of data analysis.
Visualisations help you explore data, identify patterns, and communicate insights to others.

Whilst base `R` graphics (`plot`) are useful and fast for simple plots, they have the following drawbacks:

- Documentation is atrocious - it is hard to find what you need.
- It is very fiddly to create complex plots.

For this reason, we will be using `ggplot2` for our data visualisation needs.
`ggplot2` is a powerful and flexible package that allows you to create a wide variety of plots.
Due to its popularity, people writing the best visualisation packages for `R` are almost always writing them in `ggplot2`, so understanding `ggplot2` will make it easier to use other packages.

## Introduction

`ggplot2` has an underlying philosophy, the Grammar of Graphics, which is a systematic way of thinking about visualisation.

The content below is a brief summary of the key points in the [R4DS introductory chatpter on `ggplot2`](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-visualize#creating-a-ggplot).

In reading the `R4DS` content, you will come across that term and explanations around it, but in this introduction, I will just refer to the key components of `ggplot2` that you need to know to get started.

To run the code below, you will need the `ggplot2` (installed by `tidyverse`), `palmerpenguins` and `ggthemes` packages:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| results: hide
#| message: false
pkg_vec <- c("ggplot2", "palmerpenguins", "ggthemes")
for (x in pkg_vec) {
  if (!requireNamespace(x, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(x, dependencies = TRUE)
  }
  # if you want to programmatically attach
  # libraries, this is the way to to do it
  library(x, character.only = TRUE)
}
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
  ) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)",
    y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species",
    shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```

- Initial `ggplot` call:
  - Initialises the plot.
  - Parameters:
    - `data`:
      - Specifies the data.
    - `mapping`:
      - Specifies how variables are mapped to the x and y axes.
      - `aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)` maps `flipper_length_mm` to the x-axis and `body_mass_g` to the y-axis.
        - Note that you cannot pass `list(x = ..., y = ...)` to `aes()` or just write `x = ..., y = ...` directly into `ggplot`. They must be inside the `aes()` function.
    - Parameters set using the initial `ggplot` call are global to the plot, i.e. unless later geoms (`geom_point`, `geom_smooth`, etc.) override them, they will apply to all layers.
- The `+` operator:
  - Adds layers to the plot.
  - Each `+` adds a new layer.
  - Note that it must come at the *end* of the line - if you put it at the start of a line, `R` will think that this line is separate from the previous one, as the previous one will have ended.
- `geom_point`:
  - Adds points to the plot.
    - `aes(color = species, shape = species)` maps the `species` variable to both color and shape.
    - Since the initial `ggplot` call included the mapping `aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)`, the `geom_point` call does not need to repeat this mapping. It will automatically use `flipper_length_mm` for the x-axis and `body_mass_g` for the y-axis.
- `geom_smooth`:
  - Adds a best-fit line to the plot.
    - `method = "lm"` specifies that the line should be a linear model.
      - `method = "loess"` would fit a loess curve, which is what your prac2 asks for.
  - Like `geom_point`, it does not need to specify the mapping since it inherits it from the initial `ggplot` call.
- `labs`:  
  - Adds labels to the plot.
    - `title`, `subtitle`, `x`, `y` are plot and axis titles.
    - `color`, and `shape` are legend titles.
- `scale_color_colorblind`:
  - Changes the color palette to a colorblind-friendly one.

To get a feel for what different elements are doing, you can drop them from the plot and see what changes.

## Summary

Below is a concise summary of the key information on `ggplot2`:

### Basic Structure

- **Initiating a Plot**:  
  Use `ggplot(data, aes(x, y))` to start a plot. This sets up the canvas by specifying the data and how variables are mapped to the x and y axes.
  Note that without specifying any `geom`s (see below), you will not see any content:

  ```{r}
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))
  ```

### Aesthetic Mappings

- **Mapping Variables to Visual Properties**:  
  Inside `aes()`, map variables to aesthetics such as:
  
  - **Color**: Differentiates groups (e.g., `aes(color = species)`).
  - **Shape**: Uses different symbols for groups (e.g., `aes(shape = species)`).
  - **Size**: Can reflect magnitude differences.
  
  ```{r}
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species))
  ```

### Geometric Objects (Geoms)

- **Different Plot Types**:  
  Add layers to your plot using geoms. Common examples include:
  
  - **Scatterplots**: `geom_point()`
  - **Smooth Lines**: `geom_smooth()` (e.g., for adding a best-fit line)
  - **Bar Charts**: `geom_bar()` or `geom_col()`
  - **Histograms and Density Plots**: `geom_histogram()`, `geom_density()`
  
  ```{r}
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm")
  ```

### Layering and Customization

- **Adding Layers**:  
  Combine multiple geoms to add detail to your plot. Layers are added using the `+` operator.

- **Custom Labels and Themes**:  
  Enhance your plot with titles, axis labels, and legends using `labs()` and adjust appearance with theme functions.
  
  ```r
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
    labs(
      title = "Body mass and flipper length",
      subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
      x = "Flipper length (mm)",
      y = "Body mass (g)",
      color = "Species",
      shape = "Species"
    ) +
    scale_color_colorblind()
  ```

### Faceting

- **Splitting Data into Panels**:  
  Use faceting (with `facet_wrap()` or `facet_grid()`) to create subplots based on a categorical variable, making it easier to compare groups.
  
  ```{r}
  ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
    geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
    facet_wrap(~ island)
  ```

### Saving Your Plots

- **Exporting Graphics**:  
  Use `ggsave()` to save the most recent plot to a file  {#sec-day4-prac}(e.g., PNG, PDF).
  
  ```r
  ggsave("penguin-plot.png")
  ```

## Combining Plots with cowplot::plot_grid

When you want to display multiple plots side by side (or in a grid), the **cowplot** package provides the convenient function `plot_grid()`.
This function not only aligns axes but also lets you add labels (e.g., “A”, “B”, …) so that each subplot is clearly identified.
This is especially useful in academic work where figures need to be self-contained and cross-referenced.

Here’s an example of combining two ggplot figures:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| results: hide
#| message: false
# Install and load cowplot if not already installed
if (!requireNamespace("cowplot", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("cowplot")
}
library(cowplot)

# Create two example plots
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)

p1 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: Flipper Length vs Body Mass") +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_cowplot()  # using cowplot theme for consistent font sizes

p2 <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
  labs(title = "Scatterplot: Bill Length vs Bill Depth") +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_cowplot()

# Combine the two plots into one figure with labels
combined_plot <- plot_grid(
  p1, p2,
  labels = c("A", "B"),    # Add subplot labels
  label_size = 16,         # Adjust label size if needed
  align = "hv",            # Align both horizontally and vertically
  ncol = 1
)                # Arrange side by side
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
# Print the combined plot
combined_plot
```

As always, there are other packages that can achieve this (e.g. `patchwork`), but I'm familiar with `cowplot`.

## Adequate Text Size

When creating plots, ensure that the text is large enough to be easily read.
An appropriate minimum text size varies by forat (e.g. 2m x 1m poster vs a presentation), so look online for specifics (e.g. no less than 14pt for a poster, or whatever it is).

Typically, the `ggplot2` default theme's text size is too small.
I therefore always use the `cowplot::theme_cowplot()` theme, as it a) has a larger default text size, and b) allows global changes to text size using its `font_size` parameter (e.g. across plot title, plot axis).

Here is an example:

```{r}
#| warning: false
p1 +
  # 14 is actually the default, just for demonstration
  theme_cowplot(font_size = 14) 
```

The theme is fairly minimal, so you can add gridlines, etc. if you want:

```{r}
#| warning: false
p1 + 
  theme_cowplot() +
  # can also have `minor = "xy"` for minor gridlines
  # (i.e. thinner gridlines between the thicker ones).
  # can also just specify "x" or "y" for just one axis
  background_grid(major = "xy") 
```

A final, important point regarding the theme: by default, the background is transparent, so if you save a plot to file as a PNG, the background will be transparent.
To understand, create `p1`, save it as a PNG and open it:

```{r}
#| warning: false
dir.create("_tmp", showWarnings = FALSE)
ggsave("_tmp/p-no_bg.png", plot = p1)
```

So, an unfortunately complication is that if you wish to save PNG images, then you need to usually make the background white:

```{r}
#| warning: false
p1 <- p1 +
  theme_cowplot() +
  theme(
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white")
    )
dir.create("_tmp", showWarnings = FALSE)
ggsave("_tmp/p-bg.png", plot = p1)
```

## General Guidelines for Plots

There are many guidelines for plots, but these are the main focuses: 

- **Plot is readable**: text large enough, colours and shapes distinguishable.
- **Plot is captioned and cross-referenced**: plot caption goes below the plot, and the plot is cross-referenced in the text. It should be cross referenced *before* it appears.
- **Plot is self-contained:** the plot should be understandable without needing to refer to the main text. Achieve this by:
  - Including a caption with:
    - An informative title
    - Additional sentences to describe any important details
    - Closing definitions of abbreviations or symbols used in the plot.
  - Labelling axes and legends clearly
- **Neatly formatted text**:
  - Headings should have a consistent sentence/title case
  - All text should be free of punctuation and programming syntax/formatting (e.g. `Participant_ID`).

## Captions and cross-referencing

To include a figure that is cross-referenceable, I usually save the image first to file and then use Quarto (or `LaTeX` syntax) to include it with a caption, label and cross-reference.
Even if I don't want a cross-referencable figure, I usually do this, as I find that the figure dimensions and proportions are more easily controlled this way (than just outputting the figure directly from a code chunk).

This approach is analogous to that to creating cross-referenceable tables in the `Tables` doc.

Here are the steps:

1. Save the plot to file. For example:

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| results: hide
#| message: false
dir.create("_tmp", showWarnings = FALSE)
ggsave("_tmp/penguin-plot.png", plot = p1)
```

2. If you are working within Quarto, then you can use the Quarto cross-referencing syntax (details [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/cross-references.html)), which looks like this:

```markdown
::: {#fig-penguins}

![](_tmp/penguin-plot.png)

Body mass against flipper length.

:::
```

and produces this, which can be cross referenced (`@fig-penguins` produces @fig-penguins) (note - this for some reason does not appear correctly on the website, but locally it works):

::: {#fig-penguins}

![](_tmp/penguin-plot.png)

Body mass against flipper length.

:::

- Key elements of Quarto table cross-referencing syntax for figures:
  - Opening line:
    - Begin with `:::`
    - Open curly braces
    - Write label:
      - Demarcate it with `#`
      - No spaces between `#` and label
      - Label begins with `fig-`.
      - Write remainder of label
      - Close curly braces
  - Write `![](path/to/img)` to include the image
  - Write caption
  - Close with `:::`
  - To cross-reference, write `@<label>` where `<label>` is the part immediately following the `#` in the opening of the `:::` block and *includes* the `fig-` prefix.

4. Reference the table using the syntax `@<label>`, where `<label>` is the part immediately following the `#` in the opening of the `:::` block: `@fig-penguins` produces @fig-penguins.

If you are using `LaTeX`, then you would do step 1 (save the plot) and then use `LaTeX` float creation cross-referencing syntax instead.
