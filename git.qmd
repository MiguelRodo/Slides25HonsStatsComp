# Git and GitHub

See the video `git.mp4`.

## Prerequites

1. Create a GitHub account: [GitHub](https://www.github.com).
2. Install Git: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

## Setting Up Git

In `RStudio`, open your project. 

Then, run the following code.

Firstly, ensure `usethis` is installed:

```r
if (!requireNamespace("usethis", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("usethis")
}
```

Then, if you have not set Git up before, you'll need to run the following.
Note that by "not set up Git", I do not mean whether you've installed Git, but rather
whether you've given Git basic authorship information.
If you're not sure, you can run the following:

```r
gert::git_config_global()
```

I am not exactly sure what it looks like if you've not set up Git authorship information,
but the key thing is that it will not have a row where the first column is `user.name` and the second column is your name, and a row where the first column is `user.email` and the second column is your email address.

If you can see you've not set `user.name` and `user.email`, then run the following, 
swopping `NULL` with your name and email address:

```r
# set your username and your email address
username <- NULL  # replace NULL with e.g. "Miguel Rodo" (be sure to include the quotes)
email <- NULL # replace NULL with e.g. "miguel.rodo@uct.ac.za"
stopifnot(!is.null(username)) # just checking you set this
stopifnot(!is.null(email))
gert::git_config_global_set("user.name",  username)
gert::git_config_global_set("user.email", email)
```

Finally, you are ready to initialise `git` for that project:

```r
usethis::use_git()
```

When it asks you whether you want to commit the extra files, say yes.
Be aware that you don't type "Absolutely" or "Definitely" or whatever corresponds to "yes", you just type the number that corresponds to `yes`.

After running the above, to get the `Git` pane to appear in the top right corner (alongside `Environment` and `History`), you need to close and re-open `RStudio`.

You will not need to install `usethis` and set `Git` authorship information for each project, but you will need to initialise `Git` for each project.

## Connecting Git to GitHub

Run the following code:

```r
usethis::create_github_token()
```

Name the token, set the expiry date and click on `Create`.
Then copy the token (it looks like `ghp_akerjlwk4j5qlk45j`).

Then, run the following code:

```r
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

and paste your token.
