## Submission instructions

## Rubric (/100)

The rubric below is not necessarily final and may be adjusted, but this is the basic structure:

### 1. Rendered Quarter Site (/20)

- **Full (0.5%):** The rendered document is a Quarto project (i.e. a `_site`/`_book` folder).
- **Partial (0.25%):** The practicals have been rendered using some literate programming approach (individual Quarto files, RMarkdown files or a `bookdown` project), but not a `Quarto` project.
- **None (0%):** The site fails to render.

### 2. GitHub Repository URL (/20)

- **Full (0.5%):** A correct and accessible GitHub URL is provided that seems to have all the code.
- **Partial (0.25%):** A correct and accessible GitHub URL is provided but it seems to be incomplete.
- **None (0%):** No GitHub URL is provided or it is completely incorrect.

### 3. Prac day 1, prac 2 and prac day 5 (/20 each)

For each practical:

- **Full (0.5%):** Practical is completed correctly with all required components.
- **Partial (0.25%):** Some components are completed, but noticeable issues or omissions exist.
- **None (0%):** Practical is not attempted or is entirely incorrect.

## FAQs

- How many Git/GitHub repos does this involve?
  - One. Your project should contain something like the following files and folders, which is what you should see locally and on GitHub:

```plaintext
_site/
prac-day-1.qmd
prac2.qmd
prac-day-four.qmd
_quarto.yml
```

- Should each question in each prac be answered in a separate qmd?
  - No, as per above, each prac should be in one qmd file exactly. So all questions from each practical should be answered in just one file.

- I cannot get Quarto projects to work. Can I just submit them as separate rendered HTML files?
  - You can, but you'll get part marks for that part of the rubric.

## Marking Guidelines

- We do not expect you to mark each question individually in the practicals. Instead, try assess more quickly whether it appears correct or not.
