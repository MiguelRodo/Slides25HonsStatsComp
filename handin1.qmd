# First peer-reviewed hand-in

This is your first peer-reviewed assignment for the course.

## Couse mark contribution

This hand-in counts 2.5% towards your final mark for the course.

## Due date

This Tuesday (11 February), MIDNIGHT.

## Required practicals

It consists of three practical exercises:

1. **Prac 1:** (available [here](https://miguelrodo.github.io/Slides25HonsStatsComp/prac1.html))  
2. **Prac 2:** (uploaded to Amathuba under the `Day Two / Three` section)  
3. **Practical Day Four:** (available [here](https://miguelrodo.github.io/Slides25HonsStatsComp/prac-day-four.html))

## Submission instructions

1. **Render Your Quarter Site:**  
   Ensure your site is correctly generated in the `_site` (or `_book`) folder.

2. **Zip the Rendered Site:**  
   Compress the rendered site into one zip file.

3. **Upload:**  
   Submit the zip file via the assignment page on Amathuba.

4. **Include GitHub URL:**  
   In your submission, clearly state the URL to your GitHub repository (i.e, `github.com/yourusername/yourrepo`, e.g. `github.com/MiguelRodo/Slides25HonsStatsComp`) where your assignment code can be viewed.

## Recommended Format for QMD Files  

Make your submission easy to review by:  

- **Using clear headings** (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) for structure.  
- **Echoing key code chunks** (`#| echo: true`) so code is visible in the rendered document.  

This helps your peers navigate and assess your work quickly.
If they cannot really read what you did, then they can mark you incorrect.

## Rubric (/100)

The rubric below is not necessarily final and may be adjusted, but this is the basic structure:

### 1. Rendered Quarter Site (/20)

- **Full (20/20):** The rendered document is a Quarto project (i.e. a `_site`/`_book` folder).
- **Partial (10/20):** The practicals have been rendered using some literate programming approach (individual Quarto files, RMarkdown files or a `bookdown` project), but not a `Quarto` project.
- **None (0/20):** The site fails to render.

### 2. GitHub Repository URL (/20)

- **Full (20/20):** A correct and accessible GitHub URL is provided that seems to have all the code.
- **Partial (10/20):** A correct and accessible GitHub URL is provided but the code seems to be incomplete.
- **None (0/20):** No GitHub URL is provided or it is completely incorrect or incomplete.

### 3. Prac day 1, prac 2 and prac day 4 (/20 each)

For each practical:

- **Full (20/20):** Practical is completed correctly with all required components.
- **Partial (10/20):** Some components are completed, but noticeable issues or omissions exist.
- **None (0/20):** Practical is not attempted or is entirely incorrect.

Note that `prac day 4` was previously `prac day 5`, but the numbering was changed.

## FAQs

- How many Git/GitHub repos does this involve?
  - One. Your project should contain something like the following files and folders, which is what you should see locally and on GitHub:

```plaintext
_site/
prac-day-1.qmd
prac2.qmd
prac-day-four.qmd
_quarto.yml
```

- Should each question in each prac be answered in a separate qmd?
  - No, as per above, each prac should be in one qmd file exactly. So all questions from each practical should be answered in just one file.

- I cannot get Quarto projects to work. Can I just submit them as separate rendered HTML files?
  - You can, but you'll get part marks for that part of the rubric.

## Marking Guidelines

- We do not expect you to mark each question individually in the practicals. Instead, try assess more quickly whether it appears correct or not.
