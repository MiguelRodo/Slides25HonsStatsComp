# Welcome

We have a lot to cover in this bootcamp-style course. By the end, you should be able to **write acceptable assignments faster**. One of the biggest time sinks in Honours statistics is the process of writing up your analyses, which is often slowed down by two major issues:

1. Poor structure in R files and projects.
2. Slowness in reading and writing R code.

Our goal is to address both of these challenges. This course focuses on statistical computing, so many tasks will be statistical in nature.

## What About Assignments?

I won't detail all the assignments, but before term "starts", you will have:

- **Peer-reviewed assessment:**
  - Date: towards the end of next week
  - Format:
    - Collate selected practical work from the first two weeks into a Quarto project, with the code available on GitHub (Quarto and GitHub to be explained later).
    - You will each anonymously mark one other person's work.
    - We will provide a marking rubric.

- **First practical test:**  
  - Date: 13 February, 9â€“11 AM.
  - Format:
    - In-class test, I believe open-book but no internet.
    - Will center on writing `R` code and interpreting results.
