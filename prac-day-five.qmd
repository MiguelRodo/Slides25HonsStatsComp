# Practical Day Five {#sec-day5-prac}

Excellent practice is all of the questions in the [R4DS Data Visualisation introduction](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#data-visualisation), so I suggest you do them (probably skipping the non-coding questions, so as to get through the content faster).

However, for this practical, here are the questions you will need to answer:

## Question One

1. Simulate 100 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 3 and standard deviation 1. Use `ggplot2` to plot the empirical density of these, and format the plot according to best practice (e.g. with axis titles, caption, etc.).
2. Make a reference to the plot in the text (e.g. using `@fig-dens-plot`).
3. Overlay the true density of the normal distribution on the plot (hint: use `geom_line`).

## Question Two

Calculate a two-way frequency table of species of penguins and island location (from the `palmerpenguins` package's dataset), and display it according to best practices (e.g. table caption, appropriate lines, etc.).

## Question Three

Plot the distribution of the flipper length of penguins, separated by species. Create two plots: one where the species are in the same plot (hint: use the `alpha` parameter to make overlapping densities more visible), and one where they are in separate facets. Format the plots according to best practices.
