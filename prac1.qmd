# Practical One

**NOTE**: the answers to the questions below should be placed into their own qmd file in a Quarto project on GitHub.
This Quarto project (the rendered document itself, as well as the source code on GitHub) will be peer-assessed next week.

1. Find all rows in “airquality” that have missing values. Note that the `airquality` dataset in `R` is always available (just type `airquality` in the console to see it).
2. Find mean, sd, min, max for each of temperature and ozone
level.
3. For linear regression, parameter estimates can be found as
follows.
$\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$
Here, Y is the response variable, and X is the design matrix.
The cars data (an R data set, also always available in `R`) contains two variables: speed and
distance to stop. Fit a simple linear regression model to these data,
i.e. find the $\beta$ estimates, using the equation above, and matrix
calcuations in R.
4. Check that you get the same $\beta$ estimates as when fitting the
linear regression model using lm() in R.
