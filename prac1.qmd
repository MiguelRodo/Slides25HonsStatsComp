# Practical One

1. Find all rows in “airquality” that have missing values.
2. Find mean, sd, min, max for each of temperature and ozone
level.
3. For linear regression, parameter estimates can be found as
follows.
$\hat{\beta} = (X^TX)^{-1}X^TY$
Here, Y is the response variable, and X is the design matrix.
The cars data (an R data set) contains two variables: speed and
distance to stop. Fit a simple linear regression model to these data,
i.e. find the $\beta$ estimates, using the equation above, and matrix
calcuations in R.
4. Check that you get the same $\beta$ estimates as when fitting the
linear regression model using lm() in R.
