# Tackling Projects in RStudio {#sec-day1-projects}

Refer to the video `projects.mp4` for an overview of working on projects. Here are some principles for keeping your work organized and reproducible.

## Using RStudio Projects

- Click on **New Project** in the top-right corner of RStudio to create an RStudio Project.
- This creates a directory containing all the code, data, and outputs for your analysis.
- When you open a project, the working directory is automatically set to that project folder.

**Benefits:**

- **Consistent relative paths:** Avoids issues with absolute paths that vary across devices.
- **Easier collaboration:** Consistent paths make sharing scripts seamless.
- **Quick access:** Recently opened projects are available in the top-right dropdown menu.

## Organizing Project Files and Directories

A well-structured project prevents clutter and helps you locate files easily. A common folder structure might include:

| Folder Name   | Purpose                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `_raw_data/`  | Stores unmodified datasets                                   |
| `_output/`    | Contains figures, reports, and final documents                |
| `_tmp/`       | Holds intermediate files not intended for sharing             |
| `_reference/` | Keeps supplementary materials such as papers and assignment details |

*Note:* Keep scripts (e.g., `.R`, `.Rmd`, `.qmd`) in the main project directory to avoid issues with relative paths.

## Structuring R Scripts for Readability

Good script structure improves maintainability and reduces errors. Consider these guidelines:

1. **Organize Scripts Logically**
   - Begin with a setup section (load libraries and data).
   - Follow with analysis and processing steps, grouped logically.

2. **Improve Readability**
   - Keep lines at a reasonable length (even with word wrapping).
   - Use informative variable names instead of generic ones like `x` or `y`.
   - Avoid reusing variable names to prevent confusion.

3. **Use Section Headings**
   - Separate your code into sections with comment dividers (e.g., `# ---- Setup ----`).
   - RStudio recognizes these dividers and allows for code folding.

**Example of a Structured Script:**

```r
# ============================
# Setup
# ============================
library(ggplot2)              # Load required packages
data_raw <- read.csv("_raw_data/air_pollution.csv")  # Load dataset

# ============================
# Data Cleaning
# ============================
data_cleaned <- data_raw |>
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(pm2.5)) |>
  dplyr::mutate(log_pm = log(pm2.5))

# ============================
# Visualization
# ============================
ggplot(data_cleaned, aes(x = temperature, y = log_pm)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# ============================
# Model Fitting
# ============================
model <- lm(log_pm ~ temperature + humidity, data = data_cleaned)
```

## Summary of Best Practices

- Use RStudio Projects for consistent working directories and collaboration.
- Organize files into clearly named directories to avoid clutter.
- Structure your R scripts with a logical order, clear variable names, and well-defined sections.
